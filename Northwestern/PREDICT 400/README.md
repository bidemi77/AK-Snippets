# Course Description

This course is meant to introduce students to Python and make sure that everyone is at an acceptable level of math proficiency. For me, while I have experience with Python, it has been a great reminder of linear algebra concepts that I have struggled with in the past. 

While there was homework each week, there was also discussion topics that involved Python. I have included each week's assignment below.
