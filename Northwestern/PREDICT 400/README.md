# Course Description

Review of fundamental concepts from calculus, linear algebra, and probability with a focus upon applications in statistics and predictive modeling. The topics covered will include systems of linear equations and matrices, linear programming, concepts of probability underlying both classical and Bayesian statistics, differential calculus and integration. 

While there were other homework assignments each week, there were also discussion topics that involved Python. I have included each week's assignment below.
