    "# Chutes and Ladders\n",
    "\n",
    "I read an article by Joel Smith about probabilities related to the popular children's board game, Chutes and Ladders. He specifically looked at how many turns it takes to complete a game for a given number of players. To perform this analysis, Smith used Markov Chains and Minitab software. I am using Monte Carlo simulation and Python to see how closely I can get to his results.\n",

Normally, the player just moves that many spaces, but if the player gets a chute or ladder, they get moved to a predetermined space. Finally, if the resulting space is past the final spot (100), then the player does not move. "
