# Course Description

This course teaches students fundamentals of statistical analysis. This includes evaluating statistical information, performing data analyses, interpreting and communicating analytical results. The course requires students to learn use of the programming language R for statistical analysis. In addition to learning R programming, topics covered include descriptive statistics, data display, central tendency, dispersion, exploratory data analysis; probability; discrete and continuous distributions such as the normal distribution; inference, including confidence intervals and hypothesis testing; correlation; multiple linear regression; contingency tables and chi-square. Selected contemporary statistical concepts are introduced to supplement traditional statistical methods.  

## Assignments
This course had multiple projects, discussion topics, quizzes, and tests that were not open ended. I have chosen to exclude them so as not to distribute the answers. Instead, each week, we were required to answer review questions of our choice from the text and have I included mine.
