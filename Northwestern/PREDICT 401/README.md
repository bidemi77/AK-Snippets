# Course Description

This course teaches students fundamentals of statistical analysis. This includes evaluating statistical information, performing data analyses, interpreting and communicating analytical results. The course requires students to learn use of the programming language R for statistical analysis. In addition to learning R programming, topics covered include descriptive statistics, data display, central tendency, dispersion, exploratory data analysis; probability; discrete and continuous distributions such as the normal distribution; inference, including confidence intervals and hypothesis testing; correlation; multiple linear regression; contingency tables and chi-square. Selected contemporary statistical concepts are introduced to supplement traditional statistical methods.
