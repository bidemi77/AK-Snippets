# Birthday Invites

I was wondering if there was an easy way to create simple PDFs based on a data set. The example is just having a list of people to invite to a party. This way, I could create a PDF containing all of the invites and just print it once.

This would not be a fun task to do manually, and I'm sure this is something a VBA user would just do in MS Office much cleaner but thought it would be fun to try.
